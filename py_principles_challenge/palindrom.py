# Challenge
# Palindrome
# A string is a palindrome when it is the same when read backwards.

# For example, the string "bob" is a palindrome. So is "abba". But the string "abcd" is not a palindrome, because "abcd" != "dcba".

# Write a function named palindrome that takes a single string as its parameter. Your function should return True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise.

def palindrome(string):
    return string == string[::-1]
print(palindrome('racecar'))
